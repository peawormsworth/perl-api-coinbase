=================

Perl module for Coinbase API

Update: now supports on call: account_changes()

These perl modules have not been extensively tested. Please use with caution.

There is no documentation (pods) yet. But the test.pl file should get you started.

A proper Perl module will be coming for CPAN that will allow you to 'make; make test; make install'.

I promise nothing, Jeff Anderson
